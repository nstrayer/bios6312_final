## Background

> Provide a description of the scientific motivation for the analysis. Use your own words rather than copying the description provided or from some other source. By providing your understanding of the problem, the client may be able to correct any misconceptions that you had about the science. __You don't have to go into great detail here, but do give all the facts that entered into your decision process during the analysis.__ Generally this will include a statement about the overall goal you are trying to address (e.g., the disease and the public health impact of the disease), the current state of knowledge (e.g., conclusions reached in previous studies), and the specific aims of the current study. In general, to conduct an adequate statistical analysis, you need to understand about 10% of the underlying science, not every detail.- a statement about the overall goal you are trying to address

Detect connection between lipid emulsions and varying hopsital outcomes. These infusions provide life saving benefits by allowing nutrition to be taken in by patient with impared eating abilities due to massive trauma or other factor. They however, have drawbacks with some studies showing a link between emulsions and infection and death [CITATION]. 

- current state of knowledge

Lipid emulsions are supperior to glucose based approaches for outcome and risk factors [CITATION], this being said, there are some published results showing negative side-effects of lipid emulsions. There is not yet a clear concensus on how to mitigate risk from lipid emulsions. 

- specific aims of the current study

This study is attempting to determine if the use of IVFE emulsions should be witheald from critically ill patients.
